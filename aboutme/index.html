    <h2>Quinn Stoker</h2>
    <p>Hello everyone!</p>
    <p>It's great to be in this class! I was been born and raised in North Idaho with my six siblings by my wonderful mother and father.</p>
    <p>
      I am fascinated by science, technology, politics, economics... and pretty much everything else, too! In my free time I especially like reading poetical
      classics like Anne of Green Gables, The Lord of the Rings, Little Women, etc.
    </p>
    <p>I am currently studying to become a mechanical engineer.</p>
