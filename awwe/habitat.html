          An individual elephant can eat hundreds of pounds of plants every day. This means that elephant herds need very large areas to get enough food. Human
          infrastructure like fences and roads are shrinking elephant habitats and interrupting their migration patterns, leading to shortages of the food
          available to elephants.

        <p>
          When elephants are unable to eat enough food their birthrate decreases, meaning the population is unable to keep up with illegal poaching.
          Additionally, healthy genetic diversity suffers as elephant ranges become fragmented and different groups are forced away from each other.

        <p>
          As elephants become hungrier in their smaller habitats they may be enticed to eat the crops of nearby farmers. When this occurs, it can cause conflict
          between humans and elephants that sometimes leads to the tragic deaths of both humans and elephants alike.
        </p>
        <p>
          In addition to the land helping elephants, elephants help the land. As elephant herds travel they improve the biodiversity of their habitat by making
          paths for other animals, removing brush, creating clearings, and spreading seeds. Some plants depend heavily on the help of elephants.
