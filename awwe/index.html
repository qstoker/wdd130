            This amounts to tens of thousands of dead elephants every year. In a world with less than 500,000 elephants still alive, this is a tragic and
            alarming fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            Elephants have been killed for their ivory tusks for thousands of years, but never threatened elephants with extinction until far more recently due
            to both increased demand and an increased ability to transport ivory. It is estimated that there were over 10 million elephants alive in 1900, 1.3
            million in 1980, and only 600,000 by 1990.
          </p>
          <p>
            The international ivory trade was finally banned in 1990, which successfully provided some respite to the remaining elephant herds. Unfortunately, a
            resurgence in poaching has recently emerged that continues to threaten the few remaining elephants today.

              Sadly, poaching is not the only threat to elephants. Habitat loss forces elephants into smaller areas that don't have enough food for them. Visit
              our page on habitat loss to learn more.
