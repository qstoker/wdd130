      <p>
        <b>Reality of Poaching</b><br>
        Every fifteen minutes, an elephant is killed for its tusks. This amounts to tens of thousands of dead elephants every year. In a world with less than 500,000 elephants still alive, this is a tragic and alarming fact.
        <br><br>
        <b>History of Poaching</b><br>
        Elephants have been killed for their ivory tusks for thousands of years, but never threatened elephants with extinction until far more recently due to both increased demand and an increased ability to transport ivory. It is estimated that there were over 10 million elephants alive in 1900, 1.3 million in 1980, and only 600,000 by 1990.
        <br><br>
        <b>Ban and Resurgence of Poaching</b><br>
        The international ivory trade was finally banned in 1990, which successfully provided some respite to the remaining elephant herds. Unfortunately, a resurgence in poaching has recently emerged that continues to threaten the few remaining elephants today.
        <br><br>
        <b>Habitat Loss</b><br>
        Sadly, poaching is not the only threat to elephants. Habitat loss forces elephants into smaller areas that don't have enough food for them. Visit our page on habitat loss to learn more.

        Luckily, there are things you can do to help ensure our world is always one with elephants. Visit our "How you can help" page to learn more.

      <h3>Habitat</h3>
      <p>
        <b>Food and Habitat Shortages</b><br>
			  An individual elephant can eat hundreds of pounds of plants every day. This means that elephant herds need very large areas to get enough food. Human infrastructure like fences and roads are shrinking elephant habitats and interrupting their migration patterns, leading to shortages of the food available to elephants.
        <br><br>
		    <b>Elephant Health</b><br>
			  When elephants are unable to eat enough food their birthrate decreases, meaning the population is unable to keep up with illegal poaching. Additionally, healthy genetic diversity suffers as elephant ranges become fragmented and different groups are forced away from each other.
        <br><br>
		    <b>Conflict Over Crops</b><br>
			  As elephants become hungrier in their smaller habitats they may be enticed to eat the crops of nearby farmers. When this occurs, it can cause conflict between humans and elephants that sometimes lead to the tragic deaths of both humans and elephants alike.
        <br><br>
		    <b>Biodiversity</b><br>
			  In addition to the land helping elephants, elephants help the land. As elephant herds travel they improve the biodiversity of their habitat by making paths for other animals, removing brush, creating clearings, and spreading seeds. Some plants depend heavily on the help of elephants.
        <br><br>

			  Luckily, there are things you can do to help ensure our world is always one with elephants. Visit our "How you can help" page to learn more.

      <h3>How You Can Help</h3>
      <p>
        <b>You Can Help</b><br>
			  Elephants are incredible animals that are irreplaceable. If you want to help make sure we always live in a world with elephants, there are a few things you can do.
        <br><br>
		    <b>Avoid ivory</b><br>
			  Elephants are poached for their tusks. These tusks are made into ivory carvings, jewelry, ornaments, and other items. If people stop buying things made of ivory then poachers won't be able to make money off of killing elephants and will stop.
        <br><br>
		    <b>Speaking Up</b><br>
			  Other people won't take steps to protect elephants unless they know how much trouble elephants are in. Speaking up about stopping elephant poachers and habitat loss helps inspire others to make changes and offer their support. Widespread support can even cause companies and governments to help.
        <br><br>
		    <b>Donating</b><br>
			  There are many organizations dedicated to helping elephants by stopping poachers, protecting habitats, and taking care of vulnerable elephants. If you can, consider donating to one of these organizations. We are impressed by Save the Elephants, who work on a range of projects designed to help elephants. You can donate to Save the Elephants at savetheelephants.org.
